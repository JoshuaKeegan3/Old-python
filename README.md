# Old-python
A couple of my first programs ever. &lt;3
These are my first three programs I ever wrote.
The first is connect four using turtle graphics
The second is black jack with really poor rules
The third is tic tak toe done with ascii art

These 3 are really special to me epecially tic tac toe and blackjack
I wrote both of them within 2 weeks of downloading python for the first time. I had no prior knowledge before that.
I worked through an online course that was provided by my school and finished the content that we would be taught in ncea level 3 in 3 weeks or so.
When my teacher saw my progress they asked me how long I had been programming for and I said the same amound as everyone else.
They couldn't beleive that I could go through that much content and that little time and told me that I had no idea what I was doing.
These two programs were proof to me that I did know what I was doing because they worked. They are not good code and I don't claim that they are but they work.
And I am proud of that.

I have only lost one game of connect four on that program before even after playing more games than I can count. I am thinking of making it work cross computer with sockets
